--->Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) operated by Amazon Web Services. Content delivery networks provide a globally-distributed network of proxy servers that cache content,
    such as web videos or other bulky media, more locally to consumers, thus improving access speed for downloading the content.

--->CloudFront has servers located in Europe (United Kingdom, Ireland, The Netherlands, Germany, Spain), Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and India), Australia, 
    South America, Africa, and several major cities in the United States. In July 2020, the service operated from 205 edge locations on six continents.

--->CloudFront operates on a pay-as-you-go basis.

--->CloudFront competes with larger CDNs, such as Akamai and Limelight Networks. Upon launch, Larry Dignan of ZDNet News stated that CloudFront could cause price and
    margin reductions for competing CDNs.
